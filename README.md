I worked approximately 7 hours collectively on this homework. I did not collaborate or work with anyone.
I think overall, I was able to successfully load the JSON data onto the map, and place the cars down
using the car icon given in the lab. Also, I was able to load the info window properly, as well as the
polyline. The one issue I had with this assignment was making sure the "closest vehicle" was actually
the closest vehicle. I believe this, though, was correct.
